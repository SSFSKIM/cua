## repro-collision-fix (development run, not a release gate)

commit 7fbe9e1caa6a7d0db26a1d86eb72f6a90e11fb4d; cua-engine 0.3.0 (e6ed649f9d91); occlusion covered; 3 blocks; 7 warm tree reads and 5 warm inputs per block

candidate: sha256 858f75ab4b1fa994bf4d58b87010ca466b2b2d95cf229c8a2d2f697d2a8b679c, x86_64-unknown-linux-musl static-pie, cua-engine 0.3.0 (e6ed649f9d91); attestation not checked (a development run); checkout not clean

negative check: the witness failed the activating stub (stacking, active, focus); the X request audit failed it (_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW ClientMessage, XTEST FakeInput, 124 requests traced)

Text commands (M2): the clipboard after each sample (the harness's prior text kept, or for clipboard_write what its owner set between the read and the write), the route cua's request must take and the routes it reported (a sample whose route differs fails its witness), the witness's allowance for the foreground route, and the text calls of each engine's bus pass:

| scene | op | engine | clipboard kept | expected route | routes | foreground allowed | PasteText / InsertText / SetTextContents |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| gedit | press_key | cua | – | – | background | – | – |

Harness preparation failures (the gate's rule, Decision Log 2026-11-01): 0 resampled and 0 invalid of 129 samples, against the run's cap of 1% (1.29).

Text restores (the oracle put the scene's first word back before a sample's preparation): pinned 0, newest 0, cua 0.

run valid; development run, not a release gate: every verdict PASS; text restores (the first word put back before a sample): pinned 0, newest 0, cua 0, finished 2026-11-02T12:53:50.615Z

desktop: started with 0x00600002 active (foreign), ended with 0x00600002 active (foreign), neither acted on; holder 0x0140000e; the harness's own trace: 4085 requests, 110 changes of a window, every one of its own
