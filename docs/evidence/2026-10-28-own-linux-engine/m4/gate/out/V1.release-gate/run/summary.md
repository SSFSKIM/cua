## m4-gate-V1 (release gate)

commit 514f5c62dd6c74b1ed24c48f112ca9c35a70eece; cua-engine 0.4.0 (514f5c62dd6c); occlusion covered; 3 blocks; 7 warm tree reads and 5 warm inputs per block

candidate: sha256 f7c12e9bc2ca415050c9dd0f955012aedc3f5d0e1fbcd8661daea7bee0b83937, x86_64-unknown-linux-musl static-pie, cua-engine 0.4.0 (514f5c62dd6c); attestation verified: .github/workflows/linux-engine.yml run https://github.com/SSFSKIM/cua/actions/runs/43405393873/attempts/1, built from 514f5c62dd6c74b1ed24c48f112ca9c35a70eece (refs/heads/feat/171-m4) on a github-hosted runner

negative check: the witness failed the activating stub (stacking, active, focus); the X request audit failed it (_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW ClientMessage, XTEST FakeInput, 124 requests traced)

Text commands (M2): the clipboard after each sample (the harness's prior text kept, or for clipboard_write what its owner set between the read and the write), the route cua's request must take and the routes it reported (a sample whose route differs fails its witness), the witness's allowance for the foreground route, and the text calls of each engine's bus pass:

desktop: started with 0x00600002 active (foreign), ended with 0x00600002 active (foreign), neither acted on; holder 0x0160000e; the harness's own trace: 13486 requests, 12301 changes of a window, every one of its own; the run's record: not run (the whole-run RECORD runs only on a private display marked CUA171_PRIVATE_DISPLAY: it can freeze X.Org 21.1 (task 41), so a person's display gets the sampled route audits instead)
