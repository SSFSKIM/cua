# linux-engine-diff

The differential harness of #171 (`docs/doperpowers/specs/2026-10-28-own-linux-engine-design.md`, Verification
system): a contract test that sends the same well-formed requests to OpenAI's two Linux engine builds and to
`cua-engine`, over the engine wire, and compares their answers. Per operation and scene it records each engine's cold
and warm timings, its output (normalized), its accessibility-bus calls, the effect read back through the tree, and the
desktop state a separate X client watches for the whole of each window-targeted request. This is M0's first cut; M1a
adds the X request audit, `--via vendor-js` and the retention cases.

Run it on an X11 desktop with AT-SPI on (the #171 VM), in the X session's environment. The scenes are windows it
opens, owns and closes: gedit on scratch files it writes, Chrome windows (in the running Chrome) on its pages under
`pages/` with unique titles, and an xterm that holds the focus so every scene window is a background window. Nothing
is logged of windows it did not open, beyond `list_windows` digests and counts.

```bash
cargo build --release --offline --manifest-path scripts/linux-engine-diff/xprobe/Cargo.toml   # the witness and probes
node scripts/linux-engine-diff.mjs --check-wire --vendor-js "$SKY"
node scripts/linux-engine-diff.mjs --vendor "$VENDOR" --newest "$NEWEST" --cua "$BUILT" \
  --scene gedit,chrome,over-budget,big-text --ops all --out "$OUT"
```

## What a run does

- **Blocks.** A block is one engine, its process started fresh, then the cold sample (the first request, timed from
  the spawn) and the warm series (`--samples-tree 7`, `--samples-input 5`). Blocks rotate the engine order
  (`--blocks 3`), so engines interleave without sharing a process.
- **Windows.** Tree reads of a scene serve every engine (one shared window). Screenshots and input go to each
  engine's own equivalent window (same page or file content, same size and place), so one engine's retained window is
  never another's.
- **Ops.** `list_windows` (scene `desktop`), `tree` (`get_window_state` without the screenshot), `tree_shot` (with
  it), `press_key` and `click`. Scenes: `gedit` and `chrome` (every op), `over-budget` (a page far over the 5,000-node
  admission limit, deep and wide) and `big-text` (one entry over 4 MiB: a single reply larger than the frontier's
  byte budget), both `tree` only.
- **Comparison.** Outputs are normalized (`normalize.mjs`): native ids kept for reads of one window and mapped by
  position across equivalent windows, screenshot paths dropped, the run's window labels replaced, and Chrome's
  tab-memory text (which changes between reads of an unchanged window) replaced. Each sample is compared with the
  pinned build's; the first sample's first difference is recorded; window screenshots are compared by size and mean
  absolute pixel difference.
- **The witness** (`xprobe witness`): root `PropertyNotify` for `_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW` and
  `_NET_CLIENT_LIST_STACKING`, and the input focus and pointer every 5 ms, from before each request until 20 ms after
  its answer. Any change fails the sample. Every run with input first drives `stub-activating.mjs` (activate, act
  through XTEST, restore) and is invalid unless the witness fails it.
- **Effects.** gedit: the document's text one longer (`x`) or shorter (`BackSpace`). Chrome: the page's key or click
  counter one higher. A gedit coordinate click moves only the caret, which the tree does not show: no effect is
  recorded for it.
- **Bus calls**, in a separate untimed pass: `dbus-monitor` on the accessibility bus, counting the method calls of
  connections that said Hello during the pass (applications' and the registry's own calls are not counted), with the
  most in flight and the calls issued with nothing else outstanding.
- **Verdict** per candidate (`cua` and each `--variant`): its cold and warm medians at or below the faster vendor
  build's (the bar), every request answered, output equal, witness clean wherever a vendor build's is, effect verified
  wherever a vendor build's is.

`results.jsonl` gets one line per sample, count, check and verdict; `summary.md` is rewritten from all of it
(`--summarize` rewrites it alone). Several runs append to one directory under their `--run` names.

## M0's additions

- `--variant <label>=<flags>`: one more engine, `cua-engine` with those flags (for example
  `--variant W16='--window-calls 16'`), measured and judged like `cua`.
- `--occlusion covered|visible`: the front window covers the whole screen (default), or sits in a corner while each
  block's window is raised above the other scene windows.
- `--experiment capture-readiness`: `xprobe retention` redirects a scene window and captures it as fast as it can,
  covered and visible, recording when the contents became real and what a poll for two consecutive equal captures
  would have seen.
- `--experiment key-pace`: bursts of pipelined `press_key` requests to gedit and Chrome at lower key pacing and
  teardown waits, read back in order.
- `--record-wire`: records the spike's wire fixtures.
